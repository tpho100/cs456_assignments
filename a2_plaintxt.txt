CS456/MA456/CS556 Cryptography. Assignment 2 (Fall 2015)
For this assignment, write your own implementation of the RSA 
cryptosystem in a programming language of your choice.
Allow the user to choose the bit-length for their prime numbers. 
Your cryptosystem should encrypt only single ASCII characters from text files 
without salting.
The ciphertext should be an ASCII file that is a sequence of numbers separated by newlines. 
For the submission, send this text file back via email encrypted 
using your own separate RSA keys. 
In the email, specify the RSA modulus and the secret exponent required 
to decrypt the file so I can decrypt it properly. 
As a bonus, find the best known factoring algorithm and report how it performs 
in cracking this assignment.
